maximize your maximized apps


So I recently saw this reddit post. https://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/8tsa52/can_i_do_this_in_eos/

While this app does not do the same a gnome extension and provide the window controls in wingpannel.

It atleast allows the maximize toggle for the current active window and a close button.
